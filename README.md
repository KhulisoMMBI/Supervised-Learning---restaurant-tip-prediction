# Supervised-Learning---restaurant-tip-prediction

This project explores customer tipping behavior using a real-world dataset collected by a restaurant server in California. The aim is to build a reliable model to predict tip amounts using multiple regression and model comparison techniques.

## üìä Project Summary

- **Objective:** Predict tip amounts using customer and meal features such as total bill, time of day, day of week, and smoker status.
- **Approach:** Supervised learning using multiple linear regression, stepwise selection (AIC/BIC), ridge and lasso regularization, and interaction effects.
- **Dataset:** 200 observations from a larger dataset of restaurant bills and tips.
